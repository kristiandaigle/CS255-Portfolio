Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a company looking to set up a user interface to go along with the three packages they offer to help drivers.  They're looking to make an interface that allows the user to pick a package that they offer, schedule appointments to drive with an instructor, take tests and classes and more.  This aims to create better drivers overall.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did well explaining things both technically and to other audiences.  It's important to be able to explain projects to all audiences, as when working with other companies or other team members, because not everyone will have the same technical background or understanding. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would work through some of the diagrams again, and play around with how they're set up.  Although I'm mostly happy with them, I'd like more time to perfect them and make them as readable as possible.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It's important to consider the user's needs because if you don't make something appealing to the user, it won't be an effective tool for DriverPass.  I interpreted the user needs by taking into account what was said in the interview with them. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach is to work on the project in cycles to make something that works well.  I like to get feedback either from users or from doing checks as I go to ensure all of my goals are being met.
